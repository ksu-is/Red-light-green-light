# Red-light-green-light
This program will help keep track of what tasks you should be working on in order to complete tasks on time. It will use the colors red for tasks that are close to their due date, orange for tasks you should be working on and green for tasks that you still have a good amount of time to complete. It will serve as a task manager.

# Research
Looking at many repositoires on github and youtube i couldn't find repositories that were up to date and to my liking, so i took a few things here and there for this task manager. This youtube video helped my get started creating the task manager through the Tkinter program!
